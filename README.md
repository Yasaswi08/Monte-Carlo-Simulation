Project Outline: It is a very common trend in the hospitality industry to accept more bookings than available vacant rooms for a particular day of the year. According to previous research and real-life examples, many hotels either make extra money off- no shows or account for the risk of loss experienced when guests cancel their reservations a few days ahead of arrival using surplus room booking. Hotels also tend to make money due to cancellations as in many cases they do not refund the entire amount back to the customer.Taking into account the type of booking, class of room booked, size of booking, date of booking, gap between booking date and date of stay, hotel compensation and other variables, we try to randomly simulate a hotel reservation system.

Hypothesis:
The higher the overbooking of rooms, the higher the revenue generated by the hotel (surplus reservation is directly proportional to revenue).
The higher the cancellations, the higher the revenue generated by the hotel (room cancellation is directly proportional to revenue).
